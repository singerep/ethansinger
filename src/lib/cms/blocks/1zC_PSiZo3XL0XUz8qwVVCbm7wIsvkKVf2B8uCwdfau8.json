But, scholars have little systematic national data on the composition of the local electorate, and how compositional disparities may vary by context. In this article, we use a national voter file to compare turnout in general, midterm, and off-cycle local elections in over 500 cities. We provide novel estimates of turnout gaps by race, age, and homeownership status in local elections, and identify stark inequalities compared with national and state elections. We find sizable turnout gaps both by age and homeownership status at the local levels, far exceeding those in national contests. Turnout disparities by age and homeownership status are twice as large as those between Black and White voters, and are considerably larger in off-cycle contests.","other":[{"text":"Forthcoming in <i>Urban Affairs Review</i>."}]}]}},{"type":"svelte","value":{"component":"EntryList","subhed":"Working papers","id":"working-papers","entries":[{"title":"Allocating County-Level Absentee Ballots to Precincts","year":"2023","byline":"With Maxwell Palmer"},{"title":"Distributed Representations and Ideological Placements of Members of Congress","year":"2022","byline":"With Spencer Torene and Berk Ekmekci"}]}},{"type":"svelte","value":{"component":"EntryList","hed":"Software","id":"software","entries":[{"title":"<a href=\"https://umpscorecards.com/home/\">Umpire Scorecards</a>","description":"An online platform dedicated to measuring the accuracy, consistency, and favor of MLB umpires.","byline":"With <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethan-schwartz-a628a522b/\">Ethan Schwartz</a>"},{"title":"<a href=\"https://censaurus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">censaurus</a>","description":"A comprehensive, feature-rich, and user-oriented Python package that wraps the U.S. Census Bureau’s Data and Geographic APIs."},{"title":"<a href=\"https://github.com/singerep/crec\">crec</a>","description":"A python tool built for retrieving, structuring, and enriching the Congressional Record, the official record of the proceedings of the United States Congress. <b>crec</b> wraps the GovInfo API — a product of the U.S. Government Publishing Office — with an intuitive and powerful API of its own.","byline":"With Spencer Torene and Berk Ekmekci"}]}},{"type":"svelte","value":{"component":"EntryList","hed":"Teaching","id":"teaching","entries":[{"title":"CS 111: Introduction to Computer Science","byline":"Instructor: <a href=\"https://www.bu.edu/cs/profiles/dave-sullivan/\">Dave Sullivan</a>","description":"In Fall ‘23 and Spring ‘24, I independently taught lab sections, hosted office hours, and proctored and graded midterm and final exams."},{"title":"CDS 290/292: Civic Tech Research Design and Toolkit","byline":"Instructor: <a href=\"https://maxwellpalmer.com/\">Maxwell Palmer</a>","description":"In Spring ‘23, I assisted in designing lecture materials and lab assignments, translated R code into python and vice-versa, hosted office hours and graded weekly problem sets and reports."}]}}]
